# **What is BOLD5000 v2.0?**

BOLD5000 is a human functional MRI (fMRI) study that includes almost 5,000 distinct images depicting real-world scenes, incorporating images from the Scene UNderstanding (SUN), Common Objects in Context (COCO), and ImageNet datasets. The scale and diversity of these image datasets, combined with a slow event-related fMRI design, enables fine-grained exploration into the neural representation of a wide range of visual features, categories, and semantics. See our Nature Scientific Data paper: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0052-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0052-3)

**[BOLD5000 v2.0](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/account/home#/collections/5324846) is a complete re-release of functional data from BOLD5000, with optimized procedures for GLM estimation of brain-wide percent signal change in response to the experimental stimuli, yielding significant increases in the reliability of BOLD signal estimates compared to the initial data release.**

**Moving forward, we will continue to update BOLD5000 v2.0 with additional data versions, files for defining functional ROIs, and other relevant additions.

# **New methods for improved data quality:**

Data included in BOLD5000 v2.0 integrate three techniques designed to improve the accuracy of trial-wise GLM beta estimates:

1.  First, for each voxel, a custom hemodynamic response function (HRF) is identified from a library of candidate functions.
    
2.  Second, the selected HRFs are used in a cross-validated GLM in order to derive a set of optimized noise regressors from voxels unrelated to the experimental paradigm (‚Äú[GLMdenoise](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2013.00247/full)‚Äù; Kay et al., 2013).

3. Third, to mitigate the effects of signal overlap, beta estimates are regularized on a voxel-by-voxel basis using ridge regression (‚Äú[Fracridge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03220v1.pdf)‚Äù Kay & Rokem, 2020).

See the ‚ÄúGLM Analysis‚Äù section of the newly-available [Natural Scenes Dataset preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432340v1) for further details on these methods. Code for these approaches will be released in the near future ‚Äì **if you would like to be notified, please sign up for our listserv [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdxRc7eKOpZv5Yc6sfzWP5gi0egkDtNSPedVqpvtx_3yw4pg/viewform).**

## **Summary of new data versions:**

The initial release of BOLD5000 v2.0 contains a total of five complete new versions of the functional data, four containing GLM beta estimates of voxel-wise percent signal change in response to experimental stimuli, and one containing whole-brain data preprocessed in an identical manner as the data from specific functional ROIs (e.g. PPA, OPA, LOC, RSC) that were included in the initial BOLD5000 v1.0 release (time-series of residuals from an SPM GLM used to regress out nuisance variables following initial fmriPREP preprocessing; see ‚ÄúfMRI Data Analysis" section of the [BOLD5000 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0052-3) for further details).
